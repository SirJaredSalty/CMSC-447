# Run Application
1. Open up a terminal inside the CMSC-447 folder and activate the virtual environment by typing "env/Scripts/activate".
2. Navigate into the "source" folder and type ' $env:FLASK_APP = "Flask" ' and "flask run" to start the Flask backend server.
3. Then go into "source/HTML" and open index.html to open the leaflet frontend map.

# Notes
- HTML folder contains the frontend code, the instance folder is the SQLite database, and the Flask folder contains the backend server code.
- I'm on Windows using powershell. The commands "env/Scripts/activate" and ' $env:FLASK_APP = "Flask" ' are specific to Windows and powershell respectively.
